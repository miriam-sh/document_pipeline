This project was a significant and enjoyable challenge for me. It pushed me to learn and build under time pressure, and I truly appreciated the opportunity to work on it.

During development, due to the limited time available, I sometimes wrote things I didn’t fully understand in the moment. However, I fully intend to go back, review, and deeply understand everything I wrote — because it matters to me.

Unfortunately, I didn’t have enough time to complete the bonus challenge, which I regret.

I also didn’t manage to fully verify that the Docker setup works end-to-end. That said, the project itself works well without Docker.

Thank you for reviewing my work!
